<h1>Lacerta our CodeZero Discord Bot</h1>
</div>

### Basic Overview:

CodeZero is a Discord bot developed in JavaScript, utilizing the discord.js client library along with a lightweight web server for GitHub OAuth authentication. This enables certain commands, such as retrieving commit and pull request data.

### Requirements:

- HTTP Port: Required for GitHub OAuth, configured via `http-config.port` in `./http-config.json`.

- **MongoDB:** Used for storing user and bot-related data, including:
  - XP statistics
  - Message count statistics
  - Command usage data
  - Flags

## Language

We currently provide `3` languages

- german.json
- english.json
- lolcat.json (custom version)

Made by using the inbuild web editor...

Run it via `npm run editor` then visit `http://localhost:3000` via a browser

Note: If a german key for translation is missing, the bot will fallback to english

## Tracking

The bot collects and processes certain statistics, as visible in the source code:

- Message Statistics: Number of messages, words, and characters sent.
- Voice Statistics: Join/leave events, channel switches, and total voice time.

## GitHub OAuth
For /open-contributer, OAuth URLs are not stored. This means authentication is required each time the command is executed.

- Run `npm update <package-name>` to update a single package

or use the build in script

- npm run outdated

## Commit Naming Conventions

- `wip` – Work in progress.
- `todo` – Task that needs to be completed.
- `readme` – README updates.
- `naming` – Renaming constants, variables, or text.
- `v/version` – Version updates in package.json.

## What does ... mean?

- uptodate15: This means the message will be updated when changes occur up to 15 more minutes after the interaction execution.

## Code Quality & Development Philosophy
Software is always evolving, and CodeZero is no exception. Here’s why code may sometimes appear incomplete or unpolished:

1. Rapid Development: The goal is to ensure functionality first.
2. Changing Requirements: Features are frequently adjusted to meet new needs.
3. Ongoing Refinements: Code is continuously improved for efficiency and maintainability.
4. Organized Messiness: While some sections may seem unstructured, they function correctly. Any outstanding issues are documented in TODO (index.js).
5. Fast-Paced Changes: In the early stages, speed often takes priority over perfection.

Since CodeZero is actively in development, expect ongoing improvements and changes.
## Nicusch Versioning System (NVS)
- `0.0.1` – Minor bug fixes or small functional improvements.
- `0.1.0` – Command modifications or updates that impact functionality.
- `1.0.0` – Major changes affecting class structures and breaking compatibility.

💡 This system has been in use since 10.07.2024, but earlier commits may not follow it consistently.
## Know issues
